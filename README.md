# Music Genre Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the **classification of music genres** through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. It is inspired by and integrates concepts acquired during **master-level studies in data science and machine learning**, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical model implementation.

The objective is to analyze musical datasets, extract meaningful features, and construct models capable of identifying and categorizing music based on genre-specific characteristics.

## Project Overview

The project explores how different machine learning algorithms interpret and classify musical data by:
- Constructing representative features from the dataset  
- Evaluating model performance across multiple classification approaches  
- Comparing model behavior, accuracy, and generalization capability  

The workflow is implemented and documented within a **Jupyter Notebook**, providing transparency into data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Models Implemented

The following models are implemented and evaluated:

- **Multilinear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Sequential Gradient Boosting Classifier**

In addition, **logistic regression optimization** is performed to enhance model performance and assess how parameter adjustments influence classification accuracy and stability.

## Evaluation Strategy

- Performance comparison across models  
- Analysis of how each algorithm responds to the dataset  
- Initial exploration of **hyperparameter tuning** to improve predictive capability  

The project currently focuses on **supervised learning models**, with limited but structured experimentation in hyperparameter evaluation.

## Current Limitations

- Unsupervised learning methods are not yet integrated  
- Hyperparameter tuning is explored at a foundational level  
- Feature engineering remains an area for further refinement  

These limitations are intentional, allowing a focused and controlled evaluation of classical and ensemble-based supervised models.

## Future Work

Planned extensions of this project include:
- Integration of unsupervised learning approaches  
- More advanced and systematic hyperparameter tuning  
- Expanded feature engineering strategies  
- Deeper performance analysis and model interpretability  

The project aims to evolve into a more **discrete, structured, and performance-oriented classification framework**, reflecting both academic rigor and practical applicability.
